Common patterns/basics that you need to know in a programming language to solve competative programming problems.

### Fixed size Array
- Iterate on all elements of the array
- Get the element by its index 
- Get size of an array
- Shift element from the array to one position left
- Shift elements from the array one position right
- Delete an element from fixed size array
- Insert an element in an fixed size array
- Swap two elements in an array given the indexes
- Swap two elements in an array given the elements
- Sort an array
- Copy n-1 elements to another array
- Create a copy of an array
- Remove last element from the array with extra space
- Remove last element from the array with without extra space

### String
- Given the start and end index get a its substring
- Get a character at a index
- Split string by a delimeter
- Convert string to an array
- Search substring using regex
- Find first index of a substring
- get size of a string

### HashMap
- Create new hashMap
- Get all keys of a map
- Get all values of a map
- Iterate over all values of a map
- Update the key value pair in a map
- Given a key get its value from the map
- Given a value get its key from map
- Check if value exists in the map
- Get size of a map

### Set
- Create a new set
- Convert set to fixed size array or list
- Iterate over a set
- Check if a value exists in the set
- Get Size of a set

### Dynamically Sized List (ex. List in java, [] in python)
- Get element by index
- Copy all elements to another list
- Remove last element from list
- Remove first element from the list
- Remove element by index
- Given start and end index copy all elements that occur from start to end to another list
- swap two elements of a list given its indexes
- Convert list to preimitive fixed sized array (specific to java)
